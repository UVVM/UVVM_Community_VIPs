# UVVM_Community_VIPs
(Universal VHDL Verification Methodology Community Verification IP)
Repository for sharing UVVM compatible Verification IP (VVCs, BFMs, etc).

# Please contribute
## Community advantage 
The more VHDL VIPs we share, the easier it will be for us all to verify our FPGAs or ASICs

## Contributor advantages
By uploading your VIP to this community repository you enable other users to debug, verify and improve your VIP, thus improving the quality also for you as a contributor

## How?
To contribute create a fork of the repo, and raise a pull request, or send a request to support@bitvis.no to be added as a collaborator.

# Closed source or Commercial VIP
We want to increase the total number of VHDL VIP available, and to do that we want all types of UVVM compatible VIP in this overview.
If you have a closed source or commercial VIP, then just enter the information you like - and link to your website for more info. Please use the same structure as for the open source VIP.

# Quality
Your VIP does not need to be perfect. It doesn't even need to be completely finished. As long as you state this in the documentation.
Just uploading a first version of a VIP may trigger others to continue and improve it :-)

# Responsibility
This repository is a UVVM community repository. Thus anyone can contribute, modify,etc directly into the repository once they have been added as a collaborator.
Bitvis takes no responsibility for the contents in this repository - as checking VIP for protocols we may not even know would have been far too much work. We count on the community and VIP users to give feedback and help improving the community VIPs.
We do however reserve the right to remove unsuitable material.

# Copyright and License
For copyright and license on UVVM Community VIPs, the VIP providers should add their own copyright after the Bitvis copyright and disclaimer. The Bitvis copyright will then apply to the template, and the VIP provider copyright to the new code. VIP providers are free to use another license for their work if preferred, but the Bitvis copyright/disclaimer must always remain in the file.
