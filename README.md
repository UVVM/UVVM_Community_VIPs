# UVVM_Community_VIPs
Repository for sharing VIPs for UVVM (Universal VHDL Verification Methodology).

To contribute create a fork of the repo, and raise a pull request, or send a request to be added as a collaborator to: support@bitvis.no

# Responsibility
This repository is a UVVM community repository. Thus anyone can contribute, modify,etc directly into the repository once they have been added as a collaborator.
Bitvis takes no responsibility for the contents in this repository - as checking VIP for protocols we may not even know would have been far too much work. We count on the community and VIP users to give feedback and help improving the community VIPs
